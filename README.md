## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # will create links to local packages
$ npm run dev
```

## Concept

`solidbook` will auto-discover stories and render them in something reminiscent of Storybook. The `Book` could be rendered as a route in your app, as is done in [Bookit](https://github.com/leveluptuts/bookit).

Here, `solidbook` is a local package (see `./packages/solidbook`), i.e. this a mono repo. Ultimately this could be a standalone package, installed in the normal way.
